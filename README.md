# Java Music Library

## Overview
The Java Music Library is an educational project designed to simulate a basic music streaming service. It allows users to create, manage, and play music playlists using a centralized database of songs. By leveraging data structures such as ArrayLists for managing playlists and Circular Linked Lists for songs within those playlists, the project demonstrates efficient memory usage and object-oriented design principles. The implementation includes handling of song metadata to ensure proper accreditation, which is crucial for artist compensation.

## Features
- **Playlist Creation:** Users can create playlists from a collection of songs.
- **Music Streaming:** Play music directly from playlists without needing to copy files to the user's device, thanks to references to song files.
- **Metadata Management:** Each song includes metadata for proper artist attribution and copyright management.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Uses an ArrayList to manage playlists and Circular Linked Lists for song management within playlists.
